  abstract = {Coded mask instruments have been used in high-energy astronomy for the last forty years now and designs for future hard X-ray/low gamma-ray telescopes are still based on this technique when they need to reach moderate angular resolutions over large field of views, particularly for observations dedicated to the, now flourishing, field of time domain astrophysics. However these systems are somehow unfamiliar to the general astronomers as they actually are two-step imaging devices where the recorded picture is very different from the imaged object and the data processing takes a crucial part in the reconstruction of the sky image. Here we present the concepts of these optical systems applied to high-energy astronomy, the basic reconstruction methods including some useful formulae and the trend of the expected and observed performances as function of the system designs. We review the historical developments and recall the flown space-borne coded mask instruments along with the description of a few relevant examples of major successful implementations and future projects in space astronomy.},
